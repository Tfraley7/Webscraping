## Overview of the Project
In this project I automated Google Chrome to scrape and extract data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). To do this, I used python, pandas, beautiful soup, CSS, and splinter. Later, I would visualize this data within a jupyter notebook using matplotlib. 


### Process

To gather my data I first started by scraping the titles and preview text from https://redplanetscience.com/ .
